## Project Description
Soccer Frenzy is a blog for lovers of the beautiful game to post articles, share their thoughts and opinions on everything Soccer! It allows soccer enthusiasts to sign-up or login (for existing users) and post soccer-related articles.

The backend was developed using *GraphQL* with a *Node.js* and *Express*.js server. For the database, the project utilized *MongoDB* and the *Mongoose ODM*. Other packages utilized include `bcrypt`, `JWT`, `dotenv`, `jsonwebtoken`, `apollo-server-express` e.t.c. CSS was based mostly on *Bootstrap 5*, including *Bootstrap Icons*.
